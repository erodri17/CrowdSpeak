Crowdsourced Feedback on Accuracy of ESL Students' Speeches

CrowdSpeak is a crowd-sourced transcription program that automatically transcribes the user’s video and subsequently utilizes crowd-sourced feedback to critique the user’s tone, pronunciation, and accuracy. This provides users an outlet to independently conduct oral practice outside of a school or formal setting.
